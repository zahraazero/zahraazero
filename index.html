<p align="center">Hi everyone! Welcome to my own space!</p>
<p align="center">Here I tell everything about me *if you want to know them hehe*</p>
<p align="center">So feel free to read if you want and interested to do so ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<h4 align="center">IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ME, CHOOSE ANYTHING ON THE MENU
SO THAT IT CAN GUIDE YOU TO THE SPACE WHERE YOU CAN KNOW ME MORE IN-DEPTH! ‚ù§Ô∏è</h4>
<br>

<center><p>Telling some stories here, I'm just a normal girl who have a normal life like everyone
but I have to admit sometimes I'm not normal (which I usually get hype a lot and emosional HAHAHA)
I'm 20 years old now, and I'm still struggling for my Diploma in UiTM Kedah. Alhamdulillah
everything went well now but sometimes having stress is normal too right eventhough we're at home so
I guess there's nothing to say about it, everyone felt the same thing HAHAHA okay so you can 
know me more by reading my biodata as I tell directly about me there. For my website, I use the
theme of pastel colors because I like soft colors especially pink and that I think soft colors
suits my website. Have fun in my website! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></center>

have sacrifies everything they could have done for their children. I am beyond grateful for 
that. Now that I am 20 years old, I just want to make my parents happy with everything I do.
I just want to give them happiness like what they are doing to me right now. I want to be 
successful in everything I do and give them the best I could. I want to be a lecturer and 
give them monthly presents like every child is doing right now. I really want to make them 
happy in life ‚ù§Ô∏è May Allah give me the chance to do everything for my parents ‚ù§Ô∏è</justify></p></td>
