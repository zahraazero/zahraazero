<h1 align="center">ZAHRA AZERO's EXPERIENCE</h1>

<p align="center">Hi everyone! In this section, 
I will tell all my stories about my experience!</p>

<p align="center">Alhamdulillah, it has been 20 years of living in this
 world and somehow I still couldn't believe it that I would survive
 this far</p>

<p align="center">I really hope that everything went 
really well for me throughout my life, as I know that life isn't 
as easy as I thought either ❤️</p>

<p align="center">Feel free to read if you want to</p>

<h2 align="left"><i>BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT I HAVE EVER WANTED TO MAKE IN LIFE SO FAR!!! ❤️</h2></i>

<br>

<ol>
<li><b>FINALLY GET TO MAKE AND ORGANIZE MY OWN PROGRAM WHICH WAS "RABITHAH BERSAMA WARGA EMAS"
WITH MY TEAM IN A CLUB THAT I JOINED SINCE SEMESTER 1 WHICH WAS PEERS</li></b>

<br>

<p align="justify">Here I learned so many things especially on how to become someone with patience in taking care of our parents.
I believe that there must be definite reasons of why their children send them to the old folks home
but I really hope I do not become one of them in the future. I learned that senior citizens
need as much love as the same as we needed attention from people. Therefore, it is essential for the children
to spend some time to love and take care of our own parents. I learned a lot while handling this
program. I totally miss all the people I met there and I hope I can meet them again. It is a really great
experience to have doing this program as I have been wanting to make it since high school. Alhamdulillah
for the chance that I've got ❤️</p>

<p align="justify">This is the place of where I made my program which is at Pusat Jagaan G, 
Sungai Petani Kedah. The people there are very nice and kind and we try to interact and 
try our best to make the place become very delightful and cheerful for the old folks home
that stays there ❤️</p>

<li align="left"><b>STUDYING SO FAR AWAY FROM MY PARENTS</li></b>
<br>
<center><img src="images/uitmdihatiku.jpg" alt="UiTM Di Hatiku" border="2"></center>
<br>
<center>This was a picture of me and my friend from the same high school we went to in Sekolah
Menengah Convent Teluk Intan and this picture was in Semester 1.</center>

<br>
<br>
<center>A picture of me in Semester 3</center>
<br>

<p align="justify">Since small I have been praying to get the chance to proceed my studies in Kedah because I like
the accent so much and that I have two sisters-in-law that is from Kedah. I liked the way they talk
and that I want to learn that accent too and I got to be one of a Kedahan to proceed my Diploma.
Other than that, I also only want to proceed my studies in UiTM and not in any other university
because I liked UiTM ever since my mother was a staff of UiTM Seri Iskandar branch and I frequently
follow her to her workplace because I want to help her to take all her things before she got pension.
I have never been far from my parents as I am the youngest and the only girl in my family.
My primary school and secondary school are also around 30 minutes from home and not a boarding school.
Therefore, I used to stay at home with my parents a lot and it was quite scary to have left me alone
in Kedah to study. But alhamdulillah I manage being here with a friend of mine from high school and
a new friend in UiTM that lives near me in Seri Manjung.</p>

<br>

<li align="left"><b>HIKING!!</li></b>

<br>

<br>

<p align="justify">It was my first time having the experience of hiking because I was never exposed to such activities
like this before but I would definitely love to join any activities. I even joined Futsal club in university 
which was also my first experience of joining and I love experiencing everything ❤️ I am very grateful that 
ever since I joined UiTM, I finally get to experience so many things, including toxic friends? Yes I sure do
experienced that too (¬_¬) Well, I hope I don't go through that phase again. I'm just not tough
enough to experience those moments again.</p>

<li align="left"><b>EXPERIENCE OF HAVING SOMEONE LEAVING ME</li></b>
<br>
<center><img src="images/arwahembah.jpg" alt="With My Beloved Embah" border="2"></center>
<br>
<center>This was a picture of my mother with embah and I two weeks before my embah passed away</center>

<p align="justify">Embah is a name called for "grandmother" in Javanese as my embah is originally
from Indonesia. I love my embah so much as she's the only grandmother I have as my opah passed 
away when I was 6 years old. I barely remember anything about my opah which is actually quite
sad to me because I keep memories with me as long as I can do it. My embah is so kind. I used
to sleep with her and accompany her when she came to my house. My embah used to go to her 
kids' house to be with them and make her relations with her grandchild closer. Because of that,
I am extremely close to my embah. Before she passed away, I was the one who slept with her, 
gave her daily baths, fed her foods when she doesn't have the energy to do so. Honestly, I 
still couldn't believe that she's not here anymore with us but I know I have to accept the fact
that Allah loves her more and that I need to pray more for her. May Allah bless my embah ❤️</p>
