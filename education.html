<li><b>KINDERGARTEN OF UNITED PLANTATION BERHAD (UP)</li></b>
<p align="justify"> As I live in United Plantation Berhad since I was born, I started having my education journey
by joining this kindergarten. I guess my English is quite good because of the kindergarten? HAHAHA I
don't know (~Àò‚ñæÀò)~ I have to say probably because of that, because in the kindergarten we befriend
with everyone despite their races and religion and there are only 2 Malays there hahahaha and the others 
are Indian. However, we still speak everything in English because that is the main language we learned
and interact with each other. I still remember each one of them and I have to say I'm grateful of
knowing every one in life.</p> 
 
<br>

<li><b>TADIKA ABIM, HUTAN MELINTANG PERAK</li></b>
<p align="justify"> During my early age, here is the place where I start learning about the religion of Islam,
especially in reciting the Iqra' and Qur'an.</p>

<br>

<li><b>SK HORLEY METHODIST, TELUK INTAN PERAK</li></b>

<br>
<center><img src="images/skgang.jpg" alt="SK HORLEY METHODIST's Classmate" border="2"></center>
<p align="justify">To be honest, this is still the best place I've ever been. I still love
the environment. All my siblings studied here, so it feels like we're inherited to have the whole
siblings to study in this school HAHAHAHAA. My father also was a part of the PIBG members so he
handles things at the school too. Also, in this school, there are not many Malay people here as 
people do not really want their kids to be in this school (which I don't know why maybe because
there's SK Convent (girls' school) and St. Anthony (boys' school)? Because many parents prefer 
their kids to be in a good school and it was said that SK Horley Methodist doesn't seems to be 
one of them. Well I don't know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I have so many friends here especially Indian, and I 
learned Tamil language here too. I'm proud of being a student here, there's sooo many memories in 
this school with my friends, teachers, the uncle and aunties who worked there. I just miss them 
all ‚ô•</p>

<br>

<li><b>SRAR AR-RIDHO, HUTAN MELINTANG PERAK</li></b>
<p align="justify">I learn my religion in-depth through this school and met many friends too,
eventhough it was years back then, I still remember and befriend with them until now in the social
media. Well I know I'm quite a stalker but there's nothing wrong to still getting in contact
with everyone eventhough we're not that close like we were before üòú</p>

<br>

<li><b>SRAR AL-MASKAN, HUTAN MELINTANG PERAK</li></b>
<p align="justify">Sadly, because of a case I accidentally made (not my intention at all, I swear!!)
I moved to another school for a year until I prepare myself for the UPKK examination. I
learned a lot in this school too and met so many friends especially Malay guy friends because
I do not have much when I was in SRAR Ar-Ridho, the Malay guys I know there were just 4-5 but in
Al-Maskan I know quite a lot but just in term of knowing them and not befriend until now huhu.
But I honestly like my former guy friends from Ar-Ridho as they are all good and does not 
influence weird things to me. Now as I know, they all are good but guys in Al-Maskan, some are wild
so yea üôä The meaning of wild to me is that, they did something that guys at my age 
shouldn't do yet for example, smoking... </p>

<li><b>SMK CONVENT TELUK INTAN PERAK</li></b>
<center><img src="images/auntwsmkc.jpg" border="2"></center>
<center><p><b>My aunt infront of SMK Convent because she's cute and she was a former student 
here too üòç</center></p></b>

<p align="justify">Okay, this was also the best moment I had in life! I met sooooo many new friends
because I was new as I was from different primary school before so I tried to befriend with everyone
in the school until we got the "heart-to-heart connection" üòú At first, I regret choosing
SMK Convent because my intention to proceed my studies is to get into a boarding school which is 
SMKA Slim River as my 2nd, 5th and 6th brothers studied there, I wanted to have deeper knowledge in 
religion but I asked for SMK Convent and didn't get the approval to go to the SMKA so yea that was 
the story behind it. But I honestly DOESN'T REGRET A THING OF JOINING THIS HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE I MET 
MY BESTFRIENDS THERE. I am honestly more than grateful for having them üòç</p>

<center><img src="images/kadmatrik.jpg" border="2"></center>

<p align="justify">At the moment as I'm still studying, UiTM is also the best place and moments 
to reminisce. So many things I would love to do with my friends here. All those ups and downs 
while doing assignment were just üò≠ But I'm honestly very grateful for having friends that 
are always there to support me. They're all so kind and supportive, i just love them. It's just that, 
I have never experienced toxic friends and now that I have entered university, I learned that there 
will always be few toxicity that will be revealed by each of a person. I learned that, FINALLY. A 
friend of mine said that "aye don't be sad, you should've at least know the feelings of having toxic 
friends for at least once so that you could be aware in the future" and to be honest, I agree with 
what she said. Thinking back at the time, it's not worth it to cry over those who doesn't appreciate 
you. You go girl! (Why am I even talking about this?) By the way, UITM also have the best memories 
ever with my bestfriends! Glad I found people I can trust too here ‚ô•</p>
